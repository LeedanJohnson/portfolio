## Basic Docker

I'm very comfotable working with Docker at the command line, including:
+ launching containers from images
+ inspecting and monitoring running and stopped images
+ creating and using persistent volumes for containers
+ exposing container ports
+ linking containers
+ creating and using networks
+ building docker images

## Microservice Apps

I've created and tested apps using two separate containerized services (httpd server and mongodb database) working in tandem to fulfill requests. This includes creating persistent volume storage for the database, creating and using a separate network for the containers to communicate on with a port exposed on the host, and linking the containers so they can interact.
