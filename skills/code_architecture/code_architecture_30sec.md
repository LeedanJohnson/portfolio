# Code Architecture

I’ve recently become extremely interested in code architecture. I’ve begun to realize and appreciate more and more the difference between a well architected solution, and just a solution that works. I think well architected code is extremely important, especially for security, extensibility and maintainability. I believe good code architecture can be achieved through rigorous domain analysis and design, careful and purposeful implementation of established design patterns, test-driven development, and dedication to quality documentation.
